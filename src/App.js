                Toast is almost as old as civilization itself, made by the early Egyptians
                to put some spark back in stale bread. It's still one of the most versatile,
                delicious, and completely perfect snacks for breakfast or as a side at any meal.
                You can make toast from any kind of bread in the toaster, in the oven, over
                a fire, and learn to top with a variety of different things to your taste.
                See Step 1 to learn more about making toast.

                Scrambled eggs may be a relatively easy meal to make, but it turns out you
                are probably doing it wrong - according to chef Gordon Ramsay. Although
                scrambling a couple of eggs in a pan will result in decent eggs no matter
                what method you use, the celebrity chef has a unique technique that makes
                “scrambled eggs to die for" - even if he does say so himself.

                Place your skillet on the stovetop and turn on the heat. I leave the heat
                somewhere between medium low and medium, so it warms up but doesn't get too hot.

                nd it is the star of one of the most classic hors d’oeuvres out there,
                the cheese straw. It’s been a while since I made cheese straws, but they
                were one of the first things I made as a kid where I felt the power and
                the pleasure of making something that really impressed (and that… shhh…
                wasn’t really hard). When I picture my 8 year old self passing them at
                some party my parents were hosting, I can only hope that I wasn’t too
                eye-rollingly self-satisfied as I held up some little tray saying smugly,
                “Cheese straw?”

                You can use any kind of packaged bacon to make these, or go for some
                high end bacon—either way you have the kind of nibble or appetizer that
                people stop talking to eat.
